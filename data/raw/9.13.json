      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The project consists in the development of an open-access NH3 to H2 import terminal in Dunkerque. The project aims to create a large-scale import terminal, facilitating hydrogen imports (using green/low carbon ammonia as carrier) and its redistribution of hydrogen (via transformation of NH3 into H2) via the open-access hydrogen backbone.<br />\nThe project plans building one to two additional deep-sea jetties (allowing VLGCs of today and tomorrow to moor), up to 3 ammonia storage tanks of 100,000 m&sup3; each, up to 3 NH3 to H2 cracking units of 3,000 t/d of ammonia transformation capacity each and a connection to the open-access H2 network (including compressors, metering, etc&hellip;) connecting directly two countries: France and Belgium.<br />\nThe terminal will have the following technical characteristics:<br />\n- Injection capacity: 48 GWh/d<br />\n- Storage capacity: 300,000 m3&nbsp;<br />\nThe project is expected to lead to an increase in hydrogen reception facility send-out capacity of 0.45 Mt/y.</p>\n",
