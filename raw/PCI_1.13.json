      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p>The project will provide 1.8 GWh of storage with 360 MW generation capacity and 360 MW of pumping load. It consists of upper and lower reservoirs with capacities of approximately 2.6 million&nbsp;m3 and a head height of 300 m, power plant with pump/turbine units, intake/outlet structures, and transformers to connect to the grid. The project will have 3 x 120 MW synchronous motor/generators and associated turbines. The facility is located close to the transmission system on a former open-cast mining site.</p>\n",
