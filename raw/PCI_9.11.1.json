      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The project Ammonia Import Terminal in Brunsb&uuml;ttel aims to enable the import of a significant amount of green ammonia. Around 300,000 tons of green NH3/y will arrive via the terminal in Brunsb&uuml;ttel in a first phase. In the second phase, the overall import capacity will be increased to approximately 1.9 Mt/y of green NH3, which amount to about 0.233 Mt/y of H2 after the cracking process, which shall inject H2 into the pipeline grid.<br />\nThe hydrogen terminal, which is composed of berthing infrastructure with unloading facilities; transport pipeline from jetty/berth to the facility; ammonia storage tank; boil-off-gas system, send-out facilities (loading arms for trucks and train wagons); flare (overpressure reduction system); ammonia cracker; hydrogen metering and if necessary compression station; will have the following technical characteristics:<br />\n- NH3 Import capacity: 30 GWh/d (1.9 Mt/y)<br />\n- H2 Injection capacity: 23 GWh/d (0.233 Mt/y)<br />\n- Storage capacity: 125,000 m3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nThe project is expected to lead to a capacity increment of 23.5 GWh/d (700 t/d).</p>\n",
