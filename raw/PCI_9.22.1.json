      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p>The project consists of the construction of an underground hydrogen storage and more particularly the creation of a new salt cavern and construction of dedicated surface facilities to store 100% H2. The storage will be connected to the H2 network of Gasunie running from the Netherlands to Denmark via Hamburg where a H2 distribution network is planned.<br />\nThe project will have the following technical specifications:<br />\n- Maximum Injection rate: 17 GWh/d<br />\n- Maximum Withdrawal rate: 17 GWh/d<br />\n- Working gas volume: 205 GWh<br />\n- Expected increase in underground hydrogen storage capacity: 58 mcm<br />\nThe maximum storage volume and the injection/withdrawal capacities are subject to further investigations and may be adapted depending on market needs. The planned Working Gas Volume could be cycled several times in a year thanks to a highly-flexible plant design.<br />\nThe Harsefeld salt dome potentially allows for the creation of several caverns, enabling the following &nbsp;extension options : 2nd phase with another cavern and the necessary surface equipment &amp; 3rd phase: repurposing to H2 of existing natural gas facilities.</p>\n",
