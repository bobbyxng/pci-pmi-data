It will have an annual power generation capacity of 330-432 GWh, with cycle efficiency of 80%.</p>\n\n<p>The pumped storage plant is planned at the German-Austrian border, upstream from Jochenstein hydro power plant at the Danube. Drawdown and return of water will be ensured via Danube and a storage lake will be created approximately 350 m above the live storage of Jochenstein. The upstream water conduit is designed as an inclined shaft. The downstream water conduit joins the intake/outlet structure on the Danube underground.</p>\n",
