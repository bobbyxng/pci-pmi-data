      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p>The project consists of a new build green ammonia storage terminal and on-site ammonia cracking facilities in Antwerp, aiming to service the green ammonia market (fertilizer, chemicals &amp; marine) as well as the green hydrogen market, through cracking the ammonia to hydrogen and injecting it into the European backbone system.<br />\nAmplifhy Antwerp will be connected to other European countries (incl. Germany and Belgium) via the Belgian Hydrogen Backbone and is expected to have a significant impact on the decarbonization of northwest European countries.<br />\nAfter phase 1 &amp; 2 (phase 1 to be operational in 2028 and phase 2 in 2029/2030), the facility will have an ammonia import/storage capacity of ~0.109 Mt (~160k m3)&nbsp;and an ammonia cracking capacity of ~0.4Mt/y&nbsp;(~400ktpa).<br />\nImport capacity is based on the number of jetties at the terminal and the discharge flow rates from vessels into the terminal.</p>\n",
