      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Emil&rsquo;Hy project, spearheaded by GazelEnergie, is dedicated to establishing a renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production plant. This facility will be seamlessly integrated into the MosaHYc pipeline project, a joint effort by GRTgaz (the French gas transmission system operator) and CREOS (the German distribution operator). The MosaHYc pipeline spans over 100 kilometres, connecting France and Germany.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The project&rsquo;s overarching goal is to achieve an ultimate capacity of 400 MW. This ambitious target will be realized through a phased approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Initial Production Phase (2027): The project will kick off with a 200 MW capacity.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Second Phase (2030): An additional 200 MW will be added, bringing the total capacity to the desired level.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The heart of this production unit lies in its electrolysis process, which extracts hydrogen from water using electricity sourced from the grid.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This production unit will produce up to 0.56 Mt/y of renewable and low carbon hydrogen by electrolysis of water. The energy supply can come from either renewable sources or low-carbon electricity, ensuring compliance with the REDII delegated acts&mdash;a requirement endorsed by most hydrogen off takers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The resulting hydrogen&mdash;whether green or low-carbon&mdash;will play a pivotal role in decarbonizing industry and heavy mobility. These sectors are major contributors to pollution in the region, making Emil&rsquo;Hy&rsquo;s mission all the more critical.</p>\n",
