This MoU is in line with Germany&rsquo;s strategic energy policy to develop clean energy generated by the North Sea and broaden the possible supply for hydrogen.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The hub in Wilhelmshaven is strategically placed on the North Sea coast and can accommodate up to 2 GW capacity electrolysers with renewable energy sources such as offshore wind in order to generate locally produced green hydrogen.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The 500 MW electrolyser is expected to reach a hydrogen production of up to 0.05 Mt/y. The electricity necessary for the production of hydrogen is expected to come mainly from the electricity grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",
